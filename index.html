  <section id="about">
    <h2 class="soustitre">About me</h2>
    <p>I was born and grew up in Ukraine. During my high-school years I went to be an exchange student in the United
      States.
      After that I came back to Ukraine to go to the university. For my Masters degree I came to France where I studied
      in Toulouse Business School and in Sorbonne.
      After graduation I started working in the luxury cosmetics field.
      <br><br>
      My major competences are in:
      <ul>
        <li>Operational Marketing</li>
        <li>Business Analysis</li>
        <li>CRM</li>
      </ul>

      Since last year I'm being interested in the User Experience Design.
      After doing some reasearch about this field I decided to take a break and change my profession.
      Now I'm studying UX/UI design at Webstart.
      <br><br>
      During my studies I learned how to:
      <ul>
        <li>User research</li>
        <li>Personas</li>
        <li>Prototypes</li>
      </ul>
      ... and many other interesting aspects of User Experience Design.

  <section id="loves">
    <h2 class"soustitre">My hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my spare time as many other people I like to see my friends over a cup of coffee or a glass of wine.
      Sometimes with my close friends we take weekend trips to discover a new place or practice a new activity.
      On the cold evening nights I like to read books and watch series on Netflix.
      <br><br>
      I also like to:
      <ul>
        <li>Dance Salsa</li>
        <li>Exercise in the gym</li>
        <li>Aerial tissu</li>
      </ul>
